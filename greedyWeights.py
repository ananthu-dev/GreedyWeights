Here, the weights are sorted and took according to increasing weights.
w(i)<w(j) for floor i<j
if we are taking a weight such that it is not the minimum weight available,
then that weight should be carried through each floor. So cumulative weight
will be more than optimum value. Hence this approach will minimize total effort.

Our objective is to minimize the total effort.
In each floor, the weight of the gold carried to the next floor should be
minimized.
Here, the total gold from a floor is first deposited and we are taking two
packages with minimum weight to take it to the next floor.
Suppose we are not taking the minimum weight at one floor. Then the excess weight
we took should be carried atleast until next floor, and again we have to get it to
the top floor. So the total effort will be more than optimal.
